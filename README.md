The application allows users to easily book parking spaces, join a waiting queue when all spots are full, and receive real-time notifications when a suitable slot becomes available. It also manages reservations, tracks booking history, and enables users to pay parking fees securely through digital payments. 
Admin have full control over garage and slot creation , user details, reservations, and billing.

## Features  

- 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**  
  - Role-based access (Admin/User) using Spring Security + JWT  
  - Password reset , email verification  and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)  

- 🏢 **Garage & Slot Management**  
  - Admin can create garages , define slot dimensions.
  - Admin generates QR codes for every created slot to comfirm arrival
  - Users only see slots that fit their vehicle size

- ⏳ **Real-Time Notifications** **(---- On going ----)** 
  - Users can request "remind me later" when slots are unavailable  

- 🚗 **Reservation**
  - **Creating a Reservation**
    - Users can create a reservation for any available parking slot
    - New reservations are created with **PENDING** status ⏳
    - Solved concurrent reservation problems (if multiple users demanded the same parking slot)
    - Users can view all their reservations in one place 📋
    - When user finishes parking the slot will be released

  - **Payment Process**
    - When users arrive at the physical location and scan the QR code (each QR code represents a specific **slot number + garage ID**), they are redirected to a payment iframe
    - Upon successful payment submission, the reservation status changes to **CONFIRMED** 
    - Failed payments changes reservation to **FAILED** and release the slot immediately 
      
  - **Reservation Expiration**
    - Using **schedulers** the reservation will automatically expire if:
      - Payment is not completed within **30 minutes** of creation (I put an index on the created_at as we frequently scan it)
  

- 💳 **Payment & Billing**
  - **Fee Calculation**
    - Parking fees are calculated based on stay duration
  - **Payment Integration**
    - Secure **PayMob** integration for digital payments
    - Features include:
      - IdempotencyKey table and database lock to prevent duplicate charges 
      - HMAC verification for enhanced security
  - **Payment Confirmation**
    - Automated email receipts are sent to users after successful payment
- 📦 **Deployment & Reliability**  
  - Dockerized for deployment readiness
  - used github actions for CI / CD
  - Unit tested with JUnit5 & Mockito
    
 -  **Database**  
    -  designed DB schema that follows normalization for optimized queries and indexes
    -  used @Transactional for dependent steps and data integrety
    -  used validations for columns in the entity layer
    -  used join fetch to prevent n+1 problems
    -  specification interface for dynamic filtering 

 - **Future features**
     - create Refund for the canceled payment
     - basic notification for monolithic level  
     - add Angular later for admin dashboard and user UI
     - add "extend parking duration" with another payment request and update in the current reservation info
     - scale through :
        -  Breaking the services into microservicse
        -  Use a message queue for notifications 
        -  Add kubernetes


## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, REST API  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Payment:** PayMob API  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Testing:** JUnit5, Mockito  
- **CI/CD:** Github actions

## 🔹 Architecutre / Design Patterns Used  

- **Clean architecture**
- **DTOs** for requests and responses to decouple persistence models from exposed APIs, improving security, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.
- **Global exception handling** 
- **Strategy Design Pattern** : allowing seamless integration of any kind of paymet gateways
